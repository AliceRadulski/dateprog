Done - 1) filter is half visible when on small screen. I see this issue on the desktop Chrome browser as well, with 1336x768

Done - 2) design: long name in profile is causing the whole grid of profiles to break in search results

Done - 3) more search results animated loader: hidden below under some profiles. I suggest to show at the center of the page at the bottom. If we will make footer to be sticky then we will have some additional space there to show this animated loader

Done - 4) design: the console window is only about 3/4 of the height, need to be full height

Done - 5) Advert set close button instead of arrow

Done - 6) design: on smaller width "messages" button is shifted down (against "filter" button)

Done - 7) design issue: safari still shows emtpy background image for the main page

Done - 8) design: chat window text are to enter messages not wrapping the text but instead writes as the single line 

Done - 10) design: chat window title background color should be separate from the main background window
